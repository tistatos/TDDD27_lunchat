"Meet new people over a lunch"

I'm doing a app for you to find a restaurant to eat lunch and the ability to join
a table with new people or friends. Together you can then decide a good time.

When you sign up for the app, your facebook page likes will added so people can
get an overview of your interest.

## Technical specs
I'm going to use Ruby on rails together with React+redux. I will you PostgreSQL
as the database. The app will use login via Oauth to Facebook. The app will also
use Yelp to find restaurant.

I'm going to use Heroku for deployment

I'd like to use some sort of CI for testing but haven't found anything that
matches my need and that are free. Any suggestions?
