"Meet new people over a lunch"

I'm doing a app for you to find a restaurant to eat lunch and the ability to join
a table with new people or friends. Together you can then decide a good time.

## Technical specs
I'm going to use Ruby on rails together with React+redux. I will you PostgreSQL
as the database. The app will use login via Oauth to Facebook. The app will also
use Yelp to find restaurant
