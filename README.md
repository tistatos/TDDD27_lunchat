"Meet new people over a lunch"

I'm doing a app for you to find a restaurant to eat lunch and the ability to join
a table with new people or friends. Together you can then decide a good time.

When you sign up for the app, your facebook page likes will added so people can
get an overview of your interest.

## Technical specs
I'm going to use Ruby on rails together with React+redux. I will you PostgreSQL
as the database.

The app will use login via Oauth to Facebook. The app will also
use Yelp API to find restaurant nearby.

I will be using the free version of travis CI for test runs. The master branch
is protected from direct pushes and all Pull request to the master branch must
pass tests to be able to merge.

I'm going to use Heroku for deployment with automagic deployment from github.
